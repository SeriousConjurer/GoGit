**Ques** - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it ?

**Ans**  - It is method by which we can commit changes in our repo form the local system without entering the username and password.
           SSH has a public-private key pair with the private key stored in the local system by which it identifies the user and allows the user to make changes.
