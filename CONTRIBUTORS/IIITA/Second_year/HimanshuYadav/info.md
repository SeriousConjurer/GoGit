**Ques** - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it ?

**Ans**  - SSH key helps us to push our changes in the github without entering our username and password everytime.
           SSH has a public-private key pair with the private key stored in the local system by which it identifies the user and allows the user to push the changes.
